Hello,

I am a masters student at TUM and I am creating a DAG based distributed ledger simulation framework for my thesis. I saw your implementation of the Tangle here:
https://github.com/minh-nghia/TangleSimulator

and it was very helpful for me in creating my simulator. I wish to attribute you in my thesis, so I am writing this in the hope to contact you:)

Please write back at riswan.lathif@gmail.com

Thanks and Regards,
Riswan
